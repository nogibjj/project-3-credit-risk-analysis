## IDS721- Project 3

### Intro

For my IDS721 individual project 3, I use AWS sagemaker.


### Data


### Sagamaker and S3 Steps:
1. Prepare your data: You will need to make sure your data is in a suitable format for SageMaker and upload it to an S3 bucket.
2. Set up a SageMaker notebook instance: This will allow you to write and run your machine learning code using Jupyter notebooks in a SageMaker environment.
3. Load and preprocess the data in SageMaker: Once your data is uploaded to S3, you can load it into your notebook instance and preprocess it as necessary for training.
4. Train the model with SageMaker: You can use the ML algorithm provided by SageMaker to train your model on the preprocessed data.
5. Deploy the model: Once your model is trained, you can deploy it using SageMaker's hosting services.
6. Test the model using Batch Transform: You can use SageMaker's Batch Transform functionality to test your model on a large dataset, and compare the predicted results with the actual results.
7. Store the data securely in S3: Throughout the process, you can store your data securely in S3, which provides durable, scalable, and secure storage for your data.

1. First thing to do on launch is to open a new shell and verify virtualenv is sourced.

Things included are:

* `Makefile`

* `Pytest`

* `pandas`

* `Pylint`

* `Dockerfile`

* `GitHub copilot`

* `jupyter` and `ipython` 

* A base set of libraries for devops and web

* `githubactions`
